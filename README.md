# Arduino-Code-Examples
A respository of new and modified sketches that help others

Code (scripts) that are presented have basic principles;-

1. Presented items may be a composition of other GNU Licenced material.
2. The intent is to provide others with the benefits of code that is
   presented as a means of informing others of alternate coding techniques.
3. If developed by myself, the GNU Licence conditions apply so feel
   free to use or amend.
4. If you do make suggestions, please do me the courtesy of sending
   me a note to advise what and why the changes were made.
